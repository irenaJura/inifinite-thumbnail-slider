# infinite-thumbnail-slider
Made with HTML, CSS, jQuery (google cdn), SASS, and GULP as a build tool.
There are two rows of images with same height but different width, and they move by clicking the arrow buttons left or right.
Images appear to be infinite as they disappear and reappear on both ends.
The images to the far right move by their whole width.
